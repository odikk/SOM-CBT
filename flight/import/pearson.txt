Isoflurane (Answer C) is correct.   Bronchodilator effects make it useful in asthmatics.  Does not induce EEG changes seen with enflurane.  Less likely than halothane or enflurane to produce hepatic or renal injuries. Enflurane (A) is incorrect-muscle twitching may be linked to delayed seizures; do not use with eplipetic patients. Halothane (B) relaxes bronchiolar smooth muscle so can be used in asthamtics, but seldom used in adults because may cause hepatic necrosis with repeated exposures over a short period of time, especially in obese women. D-Ketamine emergent delirium iwth hallucinations occurs during recovery period; and cannot be used for abdominal surgery due to poor visceral analgesia.

Student must determine order of conduction blockade depending on function, type, size, or activity of nerve. Dull throbbing pain sensations through the dorsal root of the C fibers are blocked before proprioception and the somatic motor functions of the A-alpha fibers. It is difficult for the LA to penetrate the myelin sheaths so myelinated motor nerves are blocked last.

C is correct. Vasoconstrictors should not be used for circle block of digits or the penis because it may lead to ischemia and gangrene. By causing vasoconstriction at the site of injection, it will decrease the rate of systemic absorption and lengthen the duration of action of the LA. If used in high doses in a patient taking propranolol, it may cause hypertensive crisis followed by reflex bradycardia and cardiac arrest. Since lidocaine produces less vasodilation than procaine, the addition of a vasoconstrictor will produce less of an effect than when combined with procaine.

Causes emergence delirium when awakening.  Used for burn debridement, but not for thoracic or abdominal surgery due to poor visceral analgesia.  Contraindicated in neurosurgical procedures because it increases CSF pressure. Enflurane (A) is incorrect; complete anesthetic depresses to Stage III, plane 3 of surgical  anesthesia -analgesia is poor. Innovar (B) is a combination of psychosedative drug, droperidol, and a short-acting analgesic, fentanyl, that produces neuroleptanalgesia. Patient is indifferent to surroundings.

Answer choice A is correct.. Secondary hyperalgesia is due to the central sensitization of spinal cord neurons which are at the origin of the spinothalamic pathway such that they become responsive to synaptic input from low-theshold mechanoreceptors. Low threshold stimuli activate low-threshold mechanoreceptive afferents. Firing from these afferents reaches the spinal cord and while in the normal situation they do not provide enough excitation to fire the spinothalamic tract neurons, they do when the spinal cord synaptic circuit is in a sensitized state. Thus, touch and the firing of low-threshold mechanoreceptors with receptor fields in the area undergoing secondary hyperalgesia is interpreted as pain not low-threshold sensation as touch, vibration or pressure.","Year  Whole  Upper  Lower  Discrimination   Frequency                                         group   25%     25%     Factor             A   B    C     D   E          Mean       SD2004	85	100	64	0.36	           80   10	 0      2	  2	85.1%	   35.8""Title: 131 FJA  Pain- PAG R     ","131.

Aneurysms present usually with rupture resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage which is manifested usually with headaches, altered consciousness and focal neurological signs.  Chronic headache of long-standing duration should not be attributed to unruptured aneurysms. Vertigo is an indication of dysfunction in the peripheral vestibular apparatus or in central connections to the brain stem. Movement-provoked vertigo without other neurological symptoms is suggestive of a peripheral labyrinthine etiology.  A sudden  onset of numbness and tingling in one-half of the body, hemisensory defect, typically is due to a focal lesion in the thalamus or in the thalamocortical connections.  This is a common presentation of lacunar stroke (pure sensory stroke).  Aneurysms can also present by pressing on neighboring structures since most saccular aneurysms occur around the Circle of Willis, and aneurysmal dilation most often will compress a cranial nerve.  The most common cranial nerve that is compressed is the 3rd cranial nerve followed by the 2nd.  So unruptured aneurysm should always be in the differential diagnosis of an ocular motor nerve paralysis.

The answer is C.   Since the pKa of lidocaine (7.86) is closer to tissue pH (7.4) than that of procaine (8.92), a higher percentage will be non-ionized and lipid soluble at tissue pH and will consequently have a more rapid onset of action. Lidocaine is an amide rather than an ester, so it is not metabolized by cholinesterases. It has a longer duration of action because it is slowly metabolized in the liver.

Early acute ischemia at 4 hours (photo 2) injures neurons, the cell type most sensitive to hypoxic damage, causing bright red degeneration of neuronal cytoplasm (“red neurons”), nuclear pyknosis, and loss of normal nucleoli.  At 48 hours after irreversible ischemia (photo 3), neutrophils have invaded the infarction, and neurons appear as faintly eosinophilic ghost cells without nuclei.   At 2 months after infarction, necrotic tissue has been removed by macrophages and transformed into a cyst, with some lipid-containing macrophages still present in the cyst cavity.  Reactive gemistocytic astrocytes are present in the gliotic cyst wall (gliosis).   ","Year  Whole  Upper  Lower  Discrimination   Frequency                                         group   25%     25%     Factor    A       B        C          D         E        Mean    SD2004	45	48	41	0.12	   6	2	25	43	1	45.7%	50.1Whole Group: the percentage of students who answered the question correctly. Upper 25%: the percentage of students in the upper 25% of quiz scorers who answered this question correctly. Lower 25%: the percentage of students in the lower 25% of quiz scores who answered this question correctly. Discrimination Factor: an indication as to how well the question relates between high versus low scores.

A 66-year-old man, with a 20-year history of chronic hypertension, is excitedly packing his suitcase for a Carribean cruise with his wife.  His anticipation induces him to forget to put his antihypertensive pills in his suitcase, so he does not swallow any antihypertensive drugs while on this vacation.  On day 5 of a 7-day cruise, while playing volleyball on the cruise deck with a bunch of college students, he suddenly feels weak and then collapses.  He is rushed to the ship's medical facility, which has been recently outfitted with a CT scanner for such unexpected catastrophes. The ship's physician orders an emergency CT scan of this man's head. Which lesion will most likely be revealed by the scan?","*A. intracerebral hemorrhage involving the basal ganglia or thalamus","B. intracerebral hemorrhage involving cerebellum or pons","C. leaking arteriovenous malformation involving the basal ganglia or thalamus","D. subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured saccular (berry) aneurysm","E. subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured fusiform aneurysm","Answer A is correct (intracerebral hemorrhage involving the basal ganglia or thalamus).   Uncontrolled hypertension is the single biggest risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke, which is manifested clinically by sudden onset of severe neurologic deficits.  The most common pathologic cause of hemorrhagic stroke is intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the setting of hypertension (“hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage”).  When such hemorrhage occurs, the most likely anatomic locations are those portions of the brain supplied by deep penetrating arteries coming off the middle cerebral artery, because these arteries are most severely damaged by chronic hypertension and are most likely to rupture during an acute uncontrolled hypertensive crisis.  Accordingly, basal ganglia and thalamus are the sites most commonly affected by hypertensive ICH (65% of cases), with pons (15%) and cerebellum (10%) accounting for most of the remaining cases.   A leaking arteriovenous malformation is much less common than ICH, and usually presents with seizures or other neurologic deficits before the age of 50.   Subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured saccular aneurysm is a less common cause of hemorrhagic stroke than ICH, is most common in the fifth decade, and is more common in women.  Subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured fusiform aneurysm is rare, because these aneurysms rarely rupture, and are more likely to develop thrombosis with subsequent ischemic infarction.","Year  Whole  Upper  Lower  Discrimination   Frequency                                         group   25%     25%     Factor    A       B        C          D         E        Mean    SD2004	76	96	62	0.26	  72	6	0	12	4	76.6%	42.6""Title: 530 DL Neurotransmitter","530.

Over 95% of meningiomas exhibit benign biologic behavior, because they are slow-growing, non-invasive neoplasms which are essentially cured by complete surgical excision.  The technical challenge for neurosurgeons is to completely remove all tumor cells while causing minimal damage to adjacent normal brain tissues.  Meningiomas are treated by surgery, and only the uncommon “malignant meningioma” (defined by the demonstration of tumor cells invading the substance of the brain) would require any additional therapy beyond surgical excision.
